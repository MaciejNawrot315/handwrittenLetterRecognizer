# handwrittenLetterRecognizer

Project for BIAI clasess. Implemets a simple neural network that recoginizes handwritten letters. 

Downloads:
 download the A-Z handwritten dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format and add the .csv file to the root folder of the app
 
Imports:

1. numpy
   
   pip install numpy
   
2. tensorflow

  pip install tensorflow
  
3. pandas 
  
  pip install pandas

4. matplotlib

  pip instal matplotlib
  
 5. sklearn
 
  pip instal sklearn

that should be all.. :D

Usage:
 the notebook is split into 2 parts. 

   The first one teaches and test the network nad saves the tought model.
   --
   Changing the model of the network:
     change the value of variable "useConvolutionLayers" to True or False depending on the model you want to use


   The second one is a tool that allows to draw the letters yourself. You can swap the models using "Swap model" button (current model is dispayed in the debug console)

  project already containts teached models in the root folder.
